          Wick is a legendary hitman who had retired until a gang invades his
          house, steals his car, and kills the puppy that his late wife Helen
          had given him. This sets him on a path of revenge, returning to the
          criminal underworld and eventually coming into conflict with the
          international organization of assassins of which he was once a part.

          <h2>2014</h2>
          <p>
            Following Helen's death from a terminal illness, Wick largely
            remains isolated from society. He spends his days driving his prized
            1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1, and caring for his new dog, a beagle named
            Daisy, the last gift from his deceased wife. When Iosef Tarasov,
            Viggo's son, breaks into his home, assaults Wick, steals his car and
            kills Daisy, the vengeful Wick goes on a violent rampage. Knowing
            that Wick will likely stop at nothing to kill Iosef, Viggo attempts
            to protect his son and sends numerous assassins to stop Wick, but he
            kills them all. Wick eventually kills both Iosef and Viggo.
            Afterwards, Wick rescues a pit-bull puppy scheduled to be euthanized
            from an animal shelter and returns home.

          <h2>2017</h2>
          <p>
            After taking revenge on the Tarasovs, Wick retrieves his prized car
            from Viggo's brother, Abram, and forms a truce with him. Wick's
            hopes of returning to retirement are ruined by Camorra crime boss
            Santino D'Antonio, who demands he complete his blood oath and
            assassinate Santino's own sister, Gianna D'Antonio, allowing Santino
            to take her place at The High Table. Wick refuses, and Santino
            retaliates by destroying his house. Wick reluctantly travels to Rome
            and fulfills the oath, only to realize that Santino is targeting him
            for killing Gianna. Santino sends his bodyguard Ares and Gianna's
            former bodyguard Cassian after Wick, but ultimately Wick kills both.
            Santino places a $7 million bounty on Wick's head, after which Wick
            enlists assistance from the Bowery King. Wick, after massacring
            hordes of assassins, eventually finds Santino in the Continental,
            where no bloodshed is permitted. Wick breaks the rule by killing
            Santino on the hotel premises, forcing Winston to declare him
            "excommunicado", meaning that he has been thrown out of the
            Continental without any way to call on it again for help. Winston,
            however, gives Wick one hour to flee before the excommunicado
            becomes active and the bounty on his head is doubled and offered
            globally by The High Table.

          <h2>2019</h2>
          <p>
            Excommunicated, exhausted, and wounded, Wick prepares to escape from
            New York as assassins gather to kill him after learning of the
            enaction of the $14 million bounty on his head. Fleeing to Morocco
            using his former allegiances, Wick meets with Sofia, an old friend,
            manager of the Moroccan Continental, and someone whose marker Wick
            holds for rescuing Sofia's daughter. Sofia helps him find the Elder,
            the one man who's above the High Table itself. The Elder agrees to
            rescind the excommunicado in return for Wick killing Winston and
            serving the High Table for the remainder of his life. Wick severs
            his ring finger and offers his wedding ring to the Elder to prove
            his fealty. Wick then returns to New York and is pursued by
            assassins until he reaches the safe haven of the Continental. Wick
            reunites with Winston but decides to spare him. Instead, Wick and
            the hotel's concierge, Charon, fight against the High Table and
            their enforcers. Successfully defeating waves of attackers, Winston
            and High Table representative, The Adjudicator, have a parley on the
            hotel roof. Ultimately, Winston knowingly shoots Wick in his
            bulletproof jacket multiple times to restore his standing with the
            High Table, while not wanting to betray him, and Wick tumbles from
            the roof into the street. The Bowery King, recovering from grave
            wounds inflicted by The Adjudicator's assassin named Zero, retrieves
            the badly injured Wick in his hideout, where he tells Wick that he
            plans to declare war against the High Table and Wick agrees to join
            him.
