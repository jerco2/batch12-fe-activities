                <h1>ABOUT THE KING OF POP</h1>
                <p>
                    Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, and dancer. Dubbed the "King of Pop", 
                    he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century.
                    He influenced artists across many genres, and through stage and video performances, popularized complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, 
                    to which he gave the name, and the robot.
                    He is the most awarded music artist in history.
                    The eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie, 
                    Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5.
                    Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records, and became a solo star with his 1979 album Off the Wall.<br><br>

                <h1>LIFE & CAREER</h1>
                <h2>1958–1975: Early life and the Jackson 5</h2>
                <p>
                    Michael Joseph Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana, near Chicago, on August 29, 1958. He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, 
                    a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (née Scruse), played 
                    clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. She was a Jehovah's Witness. His father, 
                    Joseph Walter "Joe" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at U.S. Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, 
                    to supplement the family's income. Joe's great-grandfather, July "Jack" Gale, was a US Army scout; family lore held that he was also a Native American medicine man.
                     Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy). A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon,
                      died shortly after birth.<br><br>
                    In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father which included Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine.
                    Later in 1964, Michael began sharing lead vocals with Jermaine, and the group's name was changed to the Jackson 5. The Jackson 5 recorded several songs for a Gary record label, 
                    Steeltown Records; their first single, "Big Boy", was released in 1968. In January 1970, "I Want You Back" became the first Jackson 5 song to reach number one on the US Billboard Hot 100;
                     it stayed there for four weeks. Three more singles with Motown topped the chart: "ABC", "The Love You Save", and "I'll Be There".
                </p><br>

                <h2>1975–1981: Move to Epic and Off the Wall</h2>
                <p>In 1975, the Jackson 5 left Motown. They signed with Epic Records, a subsidiary of CBS Records, and renamed themselves the Jacksons. Their younger brother Randy joined the band 
                    around this time; Jermaine stayed with Motown and pursued a solo career. The Jacksons continued to tour internationally, and released six more albums between 1976 and 1984. 
                    Michael, the group's main songwriter during this time, wrote songs such as "Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)" (1978), "This Place Hotel" (1980), and "Can You Feel It" (1980).
                    Jackson's fifth solo album, Off the Wall (1979), established him as a solo performer and helped him move from the bubblegum pop of his youth to more complex sounds.
                    It produced four top 10 entries in the US: "Off the Wall", "She's Out of My Life", and the chart-topping singles "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough" and "Rock with You".
                    The album reached number three on the US Billboard 200 and sold over 20 million copies worldwide. In 1980, Jackson won three American Music Awards for his solo work: 
                    Favorite Soul/R&B Album, Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist, and Favorite Soul/R&B Single for "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough". He also won a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance 
                    for 1979 with "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough". In 1981, Jackson was the American Music Awards winner for Favorite Soul/R&B Album and Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist.
                     Jackson felt Off the Wall should have made a bigger impact, and was determined to exceed expectations with his next release. In 1980, he secured the highest royalty rate in 
                     the music industry: 37 percent of wholesale album profit.</p>
